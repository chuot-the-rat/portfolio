## Interactive Case Study Sandbox — InkLink

---

## Overview

For my portfolio punch-up, I will transform the InkLink case study from a static narrative into an **interactive design simulation tool**.

Instead of passively reading about design decisions, visitors will be able to configure constraints and see how InkLink's product direction changes in real time. The case study becomes a **rule-driven configurator** that demonstrates how product decisions shift based on context.

This will be implemented in my existing **React (Vite) application**, with Framer Motion used only for lightweight transitions.

The core focus is logic, state management, and structured rendering — not visual polish.

---

## What I Am Building

I will implement a **Simulation Mode** inside the InkLink case study.

### Users will be able to configure:

**User Type**

* Student Writer
* Academic Researcher
* Editor

**Device**

* Tablet
* Desktop

**Context Constraints (select up to 2)**

* Tight deadline
* Accessibility priority
* Offline writing need
* Collaboration priority

---

## What the System Will Generate

Based on selected inputs, the system will dynamically generate:

* **MVP Scope**
* **Removed / Deprioritized Features**
* **Tradeoffs**
* **Risks**
* **Suggested Usability Test**

These outputs will update instantly as configuration changes.

The case study becomes an interactive product decision engine rather than a fixed story.

---

## Example Scenario

Selected configuration:

* Academic Researcher
* Desktop
* Collaboration priority

Generated output:

**MVP Scope**

* Multi-pane writing layout
* Link graph visualization
* Comment threads
* Version tracking

**Removed**

* Minimal distraction-free mode
* Simplified tagging system

**Tradeoff**

* Higher cognitive load for casual users

**Risk**

* Steeper onboarding curve

**Next Test**

* Can new collaborators understand link relationships within 3 minutes?

## How This Enhances My Body of Work

This punch-up demonstrates:

* Structured state management
* Config-driven UI rendering
* Rule-based logic systems
* Reusable component architecture
* Separation of data from presentation
* Predictable UI updates

It shows that I can build **systems**, not just pages.

Rather than adding another visual project, this deepens one case study into a programmable experience.

## Technical Architecture

### State Model

The simulator will maintain a structured configuration object:

* `userType`
* `device`
* `constraints[]`

State will be managed using:

* `useReducer` (preferred for predictable state transitions)
  or
* React Context + reducer pattern

---

### Rules Engine

The core of the system will be a lightweight rule engine.

Each rule will:

* Define a condition (`when(state)`)
* Contribute structured outputs:

  * `scope[]`
  * `removed[]`
  * `tradeoffs[]`
  * `risks[]`
  * `tests[]`

All matching rules will merge their outputs into a final generated result.

This prevents hardcoded branching and keeps the logic modular and scalable.

---

### Component Structure

Planned components:

* `SimulationProvider`
* `SimulationPanel`
* `OutcomeSummary`
* `CaseStudyRenderer`
* `CompareDrawer` (stretch goal)

Folder structure:

```
src/features/sim/
  sim.types.ts
  sim.rules.ts
  sim.reducer.ts
  SimulationProvider.tsx
  SimulationPanel.tsx
  OutcomeSummary.tsx
```

---

## Interaction Details

* Real-time updates on selection change
* Animated transitions between outputs using Framer Motion
* Optional: configuration persistence using `localStorage`
* Optional: shareable configurations via URL query parameters

---

## Lo-Fi Mockup

### Simulation Panel

```
SIM MODE

User:
[ Academic Researcher ▾ ]

Device:
( ) Tablet   (•) Desktop

Constraints (max 2):
[✓] Collaboration priority
[ ] Tight deadline
[ ] Offline writing need
[ ] Accessibility priority
```

---

### Generated Output

```
MVP Scope:
- Multi-pane layout
- Graph-based linking
- Version history

Removed:
- Minimal mode

Tradeoff:
- Increased complexity

Risk:
- Higher onboarding friction

Next Test:
- Validate first-time link comprehension
```

---

## Resources I Plan to Use

* React hooks (`useReducer`, `useContext`)
* Framer Motion for state transitions
* URLSearchParams API (optional)
* localStorage API (optional)
* Modular rule pattern for output generation

---

## Fears / Uncertainties

* Branching logic could grow quickly
  → I will limit rule count and keep outputs modular

* Generated outputs may become repetitive
  → I will implement deduplication when merging rule results

* Over-scoping the feature
  → I will focus on one case study and core functionality first

---

## Minimum Viable Implementation

* Simulation panel with user, device, and constraints
* Rules engine generating structured output
* Dynamic re-rendering based on state

---

## Stretch Goals

* Compare Mode (save two configurations and diff outputs)
* URL shareable configurations
* Export configuration summary as JSON

---

## Final Objective

The goal of this punch-up is to convert InkLink into a **configurable, logic-driven design simulator** that demonstrates my ability to build interactive systems using React — not just animate interfaces.

This adds a technically meaningful, stand-alone interactive component to my portfolio.
