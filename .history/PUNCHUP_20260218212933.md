## Interactive Case Study Sandbox — InkLink

---

## Overview

For my portfolio punch-up, I will transform the InkLink case study from static into an **interactive design simulation tool**.

Instead of passively reading about design decisions, visitors will be able to configure constraints and see how InkLink's product changes in real time.

This will be implemented in my existing **React (Vite) application**, with Framer Motion used only for lightweight transitions.

---

## What I Am Building

I will implement a **Simulation Mode** inside the InkLink case study.

### Users will be able to configure:

**User Type**

* Student Writer
* Academic Researcher
* Editor

**Device**

* Tablet
* Desktop

**Context Constraints (select up to 2)**

* Tight deadline
* Accessibility priority
* Offline writing need
* Collaboration priority

---

## What the System Will Generate

Based on selected inputs, the system will dynamically generate:

* **MVP Scope**
* **Removed / Deprioritized Features**
* **Tradeoffs**
* **Risks**
* **Suggested Usability Test**

---

## Example Scenario

Selected configuration:

* Academic Researcher
* Desktop
* Collaboration priority

Generated output:

**MVP Scope**

* Multi-pane writing layout
* Link graph visualization
* Comment threads
* Version tracking

**Removed**

* Minimal distraction-free mode
* Simplified tagging system

**Tradeoff**

* Higher cognitive load for casual users

**Risk**

* Steeper onboarding curve

**Next Test**

* Can new collaborators understand link relationships within 3 minutes?

## How This Enhances My Body of Work

* Structured state management
* Rule-based logic
* Separation of data from presentation
* Predictable UI updates

---

## Interaction Details

* Real-time updates on selection change
* Animated transitions between outputs using Framer Motion
* Optional: configuration persistence using `localStorage`
* Optional: shareable configurations via URL query parameters

## Lo-Fi Mockup

### Simulation Panel

```
SIM MODE

User:
[ Academic Researcher ▾ ]

Device:
( ) Tablet   (•) Desktop

Constraints (max 2):
[✓] Collaboration priority
[ ] Tight deadline
[ ] Offline writing need
[ ] Accessibility priority
```

---

### Generated Output

```
MVP Scope:
- Multi-pane layout
- Graph-based linking
- Version history

Removed:
- Minimal mode

Tradeoff:
- Increased complexity

Risk:
- Higher onboarding friction

Next Test:
- Validate first-time link comprehension
```

## Resources I Plan to Use

* React hooks (`useReducer`, `useContext`)
* Framer Motion for state transitions
