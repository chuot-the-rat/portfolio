        "description": "FIZZU is a concept soda brand featuring bold, unexpected flavours brought to life through playful, graphic packaging. The goal of this project was to design a cohesive can series that stands out on shelf while keeping each flavour instantly recognizable. The visual system uses strong colour blocking, simple illustrations, and flowing linework to suggest movement, fizz, and flavour. Each can follows the same structure, while distinct palettes and ingredient-inspired graphics differentiate Ponzu Zing, Kewpie Pop, and Ginger Zinger at a glance.",
