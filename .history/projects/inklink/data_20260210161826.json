The ideas were there—the momentum wasn't.\n\nInkLink started with a simple question: what if writing didn't have to be a solo activity? What if the pressure of finishing was replaced by the fun of contributing?",

        "description": "We conducted peer surveys with amateur and hobbyist writers, usability testing on early concepts, and concept validation sessions to gauge interest.\n\nKey findings: Most creative writing happens on desktop or tablet—not mobile phones. Dense, text-heavy layouts discourage reading and contribution. New concepts require gentle onboarding; users won't explore without guidance.\n\nOur initial assumption was that mobile-first would work. Research quickly proved us wrong. Writers wanted screen real estate. They wanted to see the story unfold.",
