        "description": "We conducted comprehensive user research to understand apprentice pain points and training coordinator needs. Through user interviews with 15 apprentices across various trades, competitive analysis of existing training platforms, and surveys reaching 50+ users, we identified critical insights. Key findings: Apprentices need visual progress indicators to stay motivated, mobile support is essential for on-site access, and clear, jargon-free language reduces confusion. Training coordinators emphasized the importance of milestone visibility and easy progress sharing with employers.",

        "description": "Initial wireframes focused on three core screens: dashboard overview, progress pathway visualization, and competency tracking. Early feedback from apprentices revealed that traditional list-based layouts felt overwhelming and lacked motivation. We iterated toward a more visual approach, introducing a pathway metaphor that shows progress as a journey. Low-fidelity prototypes tested navigation patterns and information hierarchy, leading to decisions about card-based modules and progressive disclosure of detailed competency information.",

Iteration 1: Introduced a Visual Pathway for progress tracking, replacing static checklists with an interactive journey map. Iteration 2: Reduced cognitive load by breaking dense information into modular cards with clear visual hierarchy and breathing room. Iteration 3: Implemented motivational language patterns, replacing technical jargon with encouraging, action-oriented copy that celebrates milestones and guides next steps.",

The hero section establishes clarity and purpose, followed by benefits panels that communicate value propositions. Feature modules showcase core functionality—progress tracking, competency management, and certification pathways—using modular cards and interactive elements. A team credits section acknowledges collaboration, while a prominent CTA encourages exploration. The design system prioritizes accessibility, readability, and motivational design patterns that keep users engaged throughout their apprenticeship journey.",
