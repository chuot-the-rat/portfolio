        "description": "Apprenticeship can take over 6,000 hours. That's years of work, spread across job sites, classrooms, and bureaucratic systems—often without a clear sense of whether you're on track.\n\nEarly in our research, we kept hearing the same thing: confusion was pushing people out. Not inability. Not lack of motivation. Just confusion about where they stood and what came next.\n\nWe wanted to build something that answered one question clearly: Where am I right now?",

        "title": "The Problem",
        "description": "Apprentices in British Columbia navigate a surprisingly fragmented system. Hours are logged in one place, competencies tracked in another, and certification requirements buried in dense PDFs.\n\nFor neurotypical users, this is frustrating. For neurodivergent apprentices—who may already struggle with executive function, time blindness, or information overload—it becomes a genuine barrier to completion.\n\nThe system wasn't designed to be hostile. It just wasn't designed with these users in mind.",

        "description": "We conducted policy and documentation review (SkilledTradesBC), stakeholder conversations with industry partners, persona development based on lived experience, and team reflection sessions (our team included neurodivergent members).\n\nKey findings: Progress tracking is scattered across multiple platforms with no single source of truth. Official systems are desktop-first and difficult to use on job sites. Discrepancies between employer-logged and self-logged hours create anxiety. Neurodivergent users experience amplified cognitive load from inconsistent interfaces.\n\nWe didn't have access to a large participant pool, so we leaned into what we did have: our own team's lived experience, publicly available documentation, and honest conversations with stakeholders.",

Our advisor encouraged broad exploration, which felt productive at first but eventually led to paralysis.\n\nIt wasn't until we accepted that we couldn't solve everything that the project started moving. Narrowing our focus to neurodivergent apprentices gave us permission to go deeper instead of wider.",

We weren't trying to make things look good—we were trying to understand what information mattered most and how quickly someone could find it.\n\nThe dashboard concept emerged early. We kept asking ourselves: if an apprentice opens this app on a break, what should they see in the first three seconds?\n\nProgress bars, hour counts, and next-step prompts became the core. Everything else was secondary.",

Hours completed, hours remaining, competencies achieved—all visible at a glance.",
