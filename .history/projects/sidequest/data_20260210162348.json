        "description": "Ever had one of those Sundays where you're staring at your phone, scrolling for ideas, and nothing sounds good? You want to do something. You just don't know what.\n\nSideQuest was designed for that exact moment. It's not a directory. It's not a list of recommendations. It's a randomized push to try something unexpected—framed like a video game quest to make it feel playful instead of overwhelming.",

What about when the goal isn't optimization—it's inspiration?\n\nYoung adults (especially those new to a city) face decision fatigue. Too many options. Too much browsing. No sense of urgency or fun.",

        "description": "We surveyed 30+ young adults about how they find and decide on activities. The data showed that most people spend more time browsing than doing. They wanted novelty, but searching felt like work.\n\nKey insight: What if instead of presenting 100 options, we just gave them one? A random quest. Accept it or skip it. No browsing. No comparisons. Just commitment or rejection.",

The goal was frictionless exploration with minimal cognitive load.",
