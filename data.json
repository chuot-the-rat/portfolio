    "description": "FIZZU is a concept soda brand featuring bold, unexpected flavours brought to life through playful, graphic packaging. The goal of this project was to design a cohesive can series that stands out on shelf while keeping each flavour instantly recognizable.",
    "extended_description": "The visual system uses strong colour blocking, simple illustrations, and flowing linework to suggest movement, fizz, and flavour. Each can follows the same structure, while distinct palettes and ingredient-inspired graphics differentiate Ponzu Zing, Kewpie Pop, and Ginger Zinger at a glance. All designs were built directly on a shrink sleeve can dieline, integrating required packaging elements such as nutritional information, barcode, bilingual text, and volume markings. Final artwork was applied to realistic mockups to reflect real-world production and retail context."
